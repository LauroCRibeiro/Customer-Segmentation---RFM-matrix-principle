# Customer-Segmentation---RFM-matrix-principle

RFM means – Recency, Frequency and Monetary. RFM is basically aN old customer segmentation technique that works by using the past behaviour of your customers based on their purchases to split the customers into groups.

# Let’s See How RFM Works:

As RFM is the technique behind customer segmentation, let’s see how it manages to do that. This technique is based on three main categories, they are:

 - Recency(R) – Days since last purchase
 - Frequency(F) – Total number of purchases
 - Monetary Value(M) – How much total money the customer spent.
